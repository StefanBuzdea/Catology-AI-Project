# 🐱 Cat Breed Identification and NLP Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This Python-based project integrates **data parsing, neural networks, and natural language processing (NLP)** to develop a system capable of **identifying a cat's breed** based on descriptive attributes. The system processes structured and unstructured data, leveraging **machine learning and AI-driven text processing** to extract meaningful insights.  

## ✨ Main Functionalities  
✅ **Data Parsing & Translation** – Extract and translate new instances to expand the dataset available at [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ht5p5pg7b7/1).  
✅ **Natural Language-Based Classification** – Parse a **natural language description** of a cat, extract relevant attributes, and classify the cat's breed using a trained neural network.  
✅ **Automated Breed Descriptions** – Generate a **detailed textual description** of a cat breed based on its distinguishing features.  
✅ **Comparative Breed Analysis** – Generate a **natural language comparison** between two different cat breeds based on extracted characteristics.

## 📊 Data Modeling and Analysis  
🔍 **Dataset Quality Check** – Identify missing values, duplicate instances, and incorrect or inconsistent data points.  
📊 **Class Distribution Insights** – Display the number of instances per breed to ensure balanced classification.  
📌 **Feature Value Analysis** – Extract and analyze the **distinct values** of each attribute, displaying their frequency across the entire dataset and per class.  
📈 **Graphical Data Visualization** – Plot histograms, boxplots, and distribution graphs to interpret **feature importance and patterns**.  
🔢 **Numerical Transformation** – Convert non-numeric categorical attributes into numerical values for ML compatibility.  
📊 **Feature Correlation Analysis** – Identify correlations between attributes and target class to optimize classification accuracy.  
📥 **Dataset Expansion** – Propose methods for enriching the dataset with new instances and attributes to improve model generalization.
